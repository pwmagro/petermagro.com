i don't stick to any one genre, but there's a bit of a trend towards dubstep. give it a listen if you like.

## if you like what you hear

streaming services do not pay artists terribly well. by buying my music on [Bandcamp](https://aidolon.bandcamp.com), you're supporting me directly, as well as getting the lossless download to listen to my music wherever, whenever, forever.

however, you can still listen to my music in any number of places, including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3kpyEXe6jzGQ5m21Ou7IGM), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/wdym/1146470074), [YouTube Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3pD0-K8m9QIxfJWpljUqw), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/aidolon), and more. no matter where you go, support is always appreciated.

### a note on naming

i used to go by WDYM. however, this was awkward to say out loud, and lacked any real meaning. it literally stands for "what do you mean?"

because of this, i decided to change my name to something more memorable, and in line with the feeling i want my music to invoke - aidolon.
