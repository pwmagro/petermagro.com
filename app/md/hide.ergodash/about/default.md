# the rhythm game controller that doesn't hurt you.

i love rhythm games, especially osu!mania and Muse Dash, but playing on my keyboard wears my wrists out real fast. there's not really any good key mapping that doesn't result in bent wrists, and when you're tapping anywhere between a hundred and a thousand or more times per second, it gets tiring. fast.

i couldn't find any dedicated controllers that solve this problem. so i made my own.

## it's got features.

ergodash is designed primarily for Muse Dash, but has support for osu!mania as well with more to come. it comes equipped for menu navigation, so you don't have to reach for the keyboard or mouse while you play.

a low profile and DSA keycaps keep your hands level with your desk. inward angled keys let you relax your wrists. Kailh Box Red switches with provide a low actuation force for quick, quiet, effortless tapping. and if that's not to your liking, they're hot swappable, so you can plug in any MX-style switch your heart desires.

the plates are made from black laser-cut acrylic, with red LEDs for backlighting and underglow. everything is assembled and tested by hand. this does mean that the first sheet ever played on your new ergodash was probably Dohna Dohna no Uta. the plus side to this is that you can be confident that it's at least capable of passing Dohna Dohna no Uta.

## do it yourself.
want to save a few bucks? not afraid of a little soldering? the ergodash is also available as a bare PCB, PCB + plates, or full kit. Nearly all parts are through hole, and those that aren't are 1206 or larger. If you've never soldered SMD before, it's a great place to start.
if you really want to go full arts and crafts, all the hardware and software files are available online. go ahead and make your own from scratch, or edit the files to make ergodash your very own.
buy.

ergodash isn't yet available for purchase, but you can sign up for updates to know as soon as it is. projected price is $20-100 depending on your setup of choice.
